# SVM
You can find the [dataset](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/programming/e4hZk/support-vector-machines) here

SVM is very famous and well known technique for classification tasks, sometimes it performs even better than Logistic regression and other classification techniques.
I have used 2 datasets, one is linearly separable and other one is linearly not separable for which I have used gaussian kernel, which gives pretty good results.
